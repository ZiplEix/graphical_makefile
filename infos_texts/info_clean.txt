Delete all files in the current directory that are normally 
created by building the program. Also delete files in other 
directories if they are created by this makefile. However, 
don’t delete the files that record the configuration. Also 
preserve files that could be made by building, but normally 
aren’t because the distribution comes with them. There is no 
need to delete parent directories that were created with 
‘mkdir -p’, since they could have existed anyway.

Delete .dvi files here if they are not part of the distribution.
